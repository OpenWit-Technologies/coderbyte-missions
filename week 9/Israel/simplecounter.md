JavaScript Simple Counter

We provided some simple JavaScript code. Your goal is to modify the application so that the counter correctly displays and it increments by one whenever the button is pressed. You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the element ID's as they are.

Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.
